# Robust Darknet-traffic-detection-and-Categorization
Darknet Traffic Detection and Categorization
The dataset used for this project is CIC-Darknet2020, a merger version of ISCXTor2016 and ISCXVPN2016 datasets. This dataset for Darknet traffic has two layers. The first layer is a binary classification to classify benign and darknet data. The second layer is a multi-class classification, with eight classes defining the darknet traffic type. So, for better understanding, I divided this project into two scenarios. The first scenario deals with binary classification and the second scenario deals with multi-class classification.
